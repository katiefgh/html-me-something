                <h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
                <p>In the beginning, there were four: a cleric, devoted to Malfus, a rogue no one could trust, 
                    a ranger with impeccable aim, and a fighter with a tireless spirit.</p>
                <p>After an encounter with orcs, only one survived; the cleric received the heads of his fallen
                    friends on pikes, a gruesome reminder and warning to travel wisely. He soon found new friends
                    to protect.</p>
                <p>The barbarian, cleric, druid, fighter, rogue, and wizard traveled for many months in relative harmony 
                    before encountering a half-elf warlock. Although they remained suspicious of her motives, they 
                    took her into the group, only to find she had wandered off in the night before long.</p>
