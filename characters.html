            <p class="character-bio">Malrin was born the Half-Elf bastard of a High-Elf duchess of the Matalya Empire, and a traveling Human merchant. The circumstances of Malrin's birth were kept a secret, even from Malrin, and all but the closest family members believed that she was the child of a deceased friend of the Duchess. Politcally, Malrin was a risk, so when her uncle saw a chance to abandon her to pirates, he took the opportunity. From age 10, Malrin served upon a pirate ship, a half-elf amongst Dark Elves, learning to fight and survive. This upbringing caused Malrin to become cautious and suspicious of others, and during this time, gained a rival in a young Half-Orc, and a lover in a Dark Elf.
                After one particularly lucrative heist, Malrin's ship was ruptured by High-Elf cannon fire, and the ship sank. Malrin managed to survive, and escaped into Dwarf lands, eventually finding herself in a town called Caricayne, where she met the party. Malrin is a cautious rogue, who struggles to trust those around her, however once her trust is won, she is loyal to a fault. She does her best to appear callous, but deep down is a scared young woman, who simply wants to have a family she can trust.</p>

            <p class="character-bio">Doro started adventuring at the age of 23, he left his town of Bluewater in search of money and relics for his church. He is a cleric of Malfus- the Goddess of Cleanliness, Hygiene, and Good Health. He is from the last known temple to her, and he wants to find any knowledge he can about her and put her back into more prevalence among the other religions.</br>
        </br>He found a group and started to adventure with them as it was a good way to make money. He tries his best to do what is right and help people, but his little experience of the world makes that tricky sometimes. After adventuring for a while, he learned of an incoming threat to the world, and left his party in the night to return to his temple and prepare for the plague tide.</p>

            <p class="character-bio">Xarros ran away from home when he was young and started working on the docks until he was forced to leave town. Circumstance brought him to piracy, and he sailed as a pirate for over 10 years until he decided to leave his most recent crew, in search for a new one. He heard word of a group of people new to town that seemed a bit out of place and decided to get in with them. </br></br>His goals when he joined the party were to make money and keep on the move. He stayed with the crew in the beginning because the jobs were very profitable but over time, he made friends with some of the crew and officers. Now his goals are to keep his friends happy and safe. He sadly left the party because an unknown entity called in a favor that he must repay.</p>
