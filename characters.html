            <p class="character-bio">Malrin was born the Half-Elf bastard of a High-Elf duchess of the Matalya Empire, and a traveling Human merchant. The circumstances of Malrin's birth were kept a secret, even from Malrin, and all but the closest family members believed that she was the child of a deceased friend of the Duchess. Politcally, Malrin was a risk, so when her uncle saw a chance to abandon her to pirates, he took the opportunity. From age 10, Malrin served upon a pirate ship, a half-elf amongst Dark Elves, learning to fight and survive. This upbringing caused Malrin to become cautious and suspicious of others, and during this time, gained a rival in a young Half-Orc, and a lover in a Dark Elf.
                After one particularly lucrative heist, Malrin's ship was ruptured by High-Elf cannon fire, and the ship sank. Malrin managed to survive, and escaped into Dwarf lands, eventually finding herself in a town called Caricayne, where she met the party. Malrin is a cautious rogue, who struggles to trust those around her, however once her trust is won, she is loyal to a fault. She does her best to appear callous, but deep down is a scared young woman, who simply wants to have a family she can trust.</p>
